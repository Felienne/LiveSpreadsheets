# International Conference on Live Coding - submission templates

There are two templates available, in *markdown* (also known as
*commonmark*) format, and microsoft word.

## Microsoft word template

This template comes in the form of an MS Word document, where you
replace the example text with that of your paper. The template is
in word/iclc2015.doc.

## Markdown / commonmark

With the markdown template, you write your paper as a text file, with
simple markup to specify formatting, citations and the inclusion of
images. For more information please refer to the template itself,
which is markdown/iclc2015.txt.
